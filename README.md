# Network-Hardening

The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. The organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, there are four major vulnerabilities:

  1. The organization’s employees' share passwords.
  2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
  3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
  4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.
